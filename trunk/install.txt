Simple Install
1. Login to WordPress and go to Plugins > Add New > Upload
2. Upload foothumbnailgallery.zip and activate
3. FTG should work out of the box. Just create a gallery, then paste the shortcode into a page/post and you're done
4. Of course, this depends completely on whether you have FooBox (free or Premium) activated. Do that. It's important.
