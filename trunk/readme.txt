FooThumbnails for Galleries is designed to be the easiest way to create a Gallery that can be launched from a Thumbnail image using FooBox. With an intuitive creation "wizard", options to select your thumbnail size, text wrapping, and 7 different layout including creating your own custom layout, you have all the options you need.

Why would you want to do that? Actually, it's a really great way to have your gallery be totally responsive and social-shareable (with FooBox), while limiting the space it takes in your post. You can keep telling your story, and point folks to the gallery. FooBox supports captions so your gallery can tell a nice sub-story along the way. Here you'll find a nice demo: http://foothumbnails.mattcromwell.com/demo

**Features**

* Supports both FooBox Free and FooBox Pro without you having to add any special code at all.
* You can choose from any registered image size your theme supports for your thumbnail image.
* Creation "Wizard" that walks you through the Gallery process step by step
* Simple shortcode usage, no need to remember crazy attributes
* "Left", "Right", and "None" for text-wrapping options
* 6 Layouts
* Customize the static layouts per gallery with a custom CSS field
* Or create your own custom FooThumbnail Gallery template to put in your theme!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
1. **Where's the Options?**
I build this specifically to avoid "options", so they are built into each Gallery you create. But if you go to "Settings > FooThumbnail Gallery" you have the ability to turn on shortcodes in Text Widgets, Post Excerpts, and Category Descriptions (these are not on by default in WordPress).

2. **Where's the Support?**
For now, support is all here. I'm on it, submit a ticket here and I'll respond quickly. Please do not submit tickets at FooPlugins.com for this plugin. 

3. **Can I change the styles of the gallery?** 
Absolutely! When you get to step 5, scroll down and you'll see a dropdown that says "Do you want to customize the CSS?" Choose "Yes" and you'll see a textarea populated with your layouts styles. Edit those, save/update, and you're gold. BUT BE CAREFUL! If you select another layout, your changes to the previous layout will be lost (for now, yes, feature request, I know).
